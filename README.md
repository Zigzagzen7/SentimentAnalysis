# Sentiment Analysis

Dataset downloaded from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Sentiment+Labelled+Sentences

train.py : trains models and outputs the training accuracy.
test.py : evaluates the models on the test set.

The SEED used will affect the random split of the data into train and test sets, and therefore the results as well.
